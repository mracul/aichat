# Updated Prompt for Agent: Full-Scale Refactor of Large Project

You are tasked with efficiently refactoring a large Go project that uses CLI patterns, Bubbletea, Lip Gloss, and other libraries from our codebase. Your objectives are:

**Summarize Code Flow:**
- Map the flow from the main entry point to views and components.
- Visualize dependencies between modules/packages.

**Identify Design Constraints & Negatives:**
- List any architectural or design constraints.
- Flag negatives affecting maintainability, scalability, or performance.

**Redundancy & Consolidation:**
- Identify redundant files, duplicate logic, or unused code.
- Propose opportunities for consolidation and simplification.

**Pattern Implementation:**
- Suggest software engineering patterns (e.g., MVC, Factory, Observer) that can streamline the codebase.
- Recommend best practices for Go, CLI design, Bubbletea, Lip Gloss, and all other libraries used in the project.

**Propose Refactor Changes:**
- List all proposed changes with rationale.
- Ensure changes follow best practices for Go and all libraries in the codebase.

**Consult Documentation & Optimize:**
- Be sure to consult all available documentation.
- Use the most efficient implementation strategies that combine with the proposed refactored structure to maintain functionality while streamlining code.

**Deliverables:**
- Code flow summary and dependency map
- List of design constraints/negatives
- Areas for consolidation/redundancy removal
- Proposed patterns and refactor plan
- Rationale for each change

**Focus:**
- Maintain functionality
- Improve readability, maintainability, and scalability
- Adhere to Go idioms and best practices for CLI, Bubbletea, Lip Gloss, and all other project libraries
