Comprehensive Design Documentation Update Process
Objective

Ensure design.md delivers authoritative, detailed technical analysis for every subsection in its Table of Contents, while reflecting the latest codebase and documentation.
Step 1: Codebase Analysis (/src/)

Goal: Extract architectural insights to feed into design.md.

    Structural Audit

        Map the src/ directory hierarchy and file relationships.

        Identify:

            Core modules (e.g., controllers/, models/, views/).

            Entry points (e.g., main.js, App.vue).

            Dependency chains (e.g., how services/ inject into controllers/).

    Pattern & Principle Detection

        Note recurring patterns (e.g., MVC, Dependency Injection, Observables).

        Flag anti-patterns (e.g., tight coupling, duplicated logic).

    Behavioral Analysis

        Trace critical workflows (e.g., "How does a modal open?").

        Document state management strategies (e.g., ViewState protocol usage).

Step 2: Update Supporting Documentation (/src/documentation/)

Goal: Ensure all referenced files (e.g., structure.md, modals.md) are accurate and exhaustive.

    File-by-File Review

        For each Markdown file:

            Sync content with /src/ (e.g., update chatview.md if CompositeChatView logic changed).

            Add/revise:

                Diagrams: UML for complex systems (e.g., menu system event flow).

                Code Snippets: Key examples (e.g., ViewState protocol implementation).

                Cross-Links: Ensure design.md can hyperlink to granular details.

    Validation Checklist

        All references in design.md’s References & Cross-Links section resolve correctly.

        No duplication between files (e.g., modals.md and flow-system.md).

Step 3: Update /src/design.md with In-Depth Analysis

Goal: Expand each Table of Contents subsection into a detailed technical deep dive.
Section-Specific Requirements

For each of the 14 sections, include:

    Project Overview

        In-Depth: System boundaries, high-level goals, and why the architecture was chosen.

    File & Directory Structure

        In-Depth: Directory map with roles (e.g., utils/ vs. lib/), and how files interact.

        Example:
        markdown

        └── src/
            ├── controllers/  # Orchestrates business logic; depends on `models/`
            ├── views/       # Stateless UI components; subscribes to `ViewState`
            └── services/     # Singleton utilities injected via `Dependency.js`

    Core Architectural Principles

        In-Depth: Tradeoffs (e.g., "Why MVVM over MVC?"), constraints, and invariants.

    Navigation & Controller System

        In-Depth: Sequence diagram for route transitions, controller lifecycle hooks.

    Context & Dependency Injection

        In-Depth: DI container setup, scoping rules (e.g., "Why RequestContext is transient").

    ViewState Protocol & UI Region System

        In-Depth: Protocol methods (show(), hide()), state machine diagram.

    Menu System

        In-Depth: Event bus usage, accessibility tree implementation.

    Modal & Flow System

        In-Depth: Stack management, async flow cancellation (e.g., "How ModalManager handles interrupts").

    Composite Chat View Architecture

        In-Depth: Component composition strategy (e.g., "How MessageList and InputBar communicate").

    Extensibility & OOP Patterns

        In-Depth: Extension points (e.g., "Plugins must implement IPlugin"), SOLID adherence.

    Design Patterns & Anti-Patterns

        In-Depth: Pattern examples (e.g., Factory in DialogService), tech debt hotspots.

    Feature Set & User Experience

        In-Depth: User journey maps, performance budgets (e.g., "Chat load < 500ms").

    Review & Forward Planning

        In-Depth: Retrospective (e.g., "DI simplified testing but increased boot time"), roadmap.

    References & Cross-Links

        In-Depth: Link to specific headings in support docs (e.g., modals.md#stack-management).

Quality Checks for design.md

    Depth: Every section explains how, why, and tradeoffs.

    Code Sync: Matches /src/ and /src/documentation/.

    Visuals: Diagrams/Snippets for complex topics.

    Navigation: Table of Contents links work; cross-references resolve.

Final Review

    Consistency Pass: Terminology aligns across design.md and support docs.

    Code Sample Audit: All snippets reflect current /src/ implementations.

    Actionability Test: A new contributor could use design.md to debug the modal system.
